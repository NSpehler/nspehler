### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicolas, a full-stack developer with experience in designing modern front-end experiences, as well as a strong focus on automation, growth hacking and data scraping to help scale businesses through technology.

Most recently, I've led the Growth Engineering team at PayFit for the past 2 years and Iâ€™m currently open to new client work. Feel free to reach out and I'll be happy to discuss!
